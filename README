VMware-LabManager

This module provides a Perl API to utilize the VMware Lab Manager SOAP API for
automation. It does not provide a one-to-one mapping of the Lab Manager SOAP API,
but rather it provides an API wrapper, which combines certain SOAP calls as a
meaningful single operation. Thus this module is heavily tailored for automation
purposes. But, it should also cater to the broader audience as it still does 
provide overall functionality that might be required.

Using this module, you can checkout a config & deploy it in one single method call, 
similarly undeploy & delete in a single method call. This module also provides a 
method to get the list of all machines (and their details) that a deployed 
configuration has. Apart from that the SOAP object & auth header methods are 
exposed; So if need be, they can be used to access other SOAP calls available 
through Lab Manager SOAP service.
